Recently, I learned about the Japanese tradition of [kinstugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi), where broken pottery is repaired using gold or another rare metal.  The philosophy behind is that flaws and imperfections are not something to be hidden, but in fact contribute to the history and beauty of the object.  Not only did discovering this art explain a whole lot about [the Death Cab for Cutie album with the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi_(album)), but it also made me think about how bug fixing can fill a similar role in software engineering.

Bugs are generally viewed as mistakes or oversights, regrettable bits of code that should be fixed and forgotten.  Besides the ghost of a JIRA ticket somewhere in the abyss, there often is very little record of the bug, its history, its cause, and its eventual evolution to a presumably more correct state.  Bug fixes should be like the gold mending the two pieces of ceramic, drawing attention to that area of code like a glittering crack in a Japanese teapot.
