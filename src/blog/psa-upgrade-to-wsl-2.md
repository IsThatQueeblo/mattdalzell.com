A while back [I made it a goal to use Linux](https://mattdalzell.com/blog/2019-new-year-goals/) as the OS for my daily driver, due to concerns over telemetry in Windows 10 in addition to the superior developer experience.  I was able to stick with that through most of 2019 and the first part of 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic made it a little harder to stick with Linux, as I found myself having to use more software and hardware that was not supported.  

I switched back to using Windows 10, and to my surprise I've found myself enjoying it quite more than expected.  A large part of that is due to the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and the new [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal), which in conjunction with VS Code has made for a pretty streamlined toolset for software development.

For most of this time, I was working with the legacy WSL system, but just recently I upgraded to WSL 2 and I'm incredibly glad that I did.
