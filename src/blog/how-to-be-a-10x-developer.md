Within programmer culture, there exists the legend of the 10x software developer: an engineer so effective he or she single-handedly has the output of ten "normal" engineers.  A developer with this level of expertise can move mountains and ship projects that would otherwise fail with an average team.  These developers are the heroes of the organization, and companies fight each other to recruit and retain this level of talent.

While the 10x concept is sometimes scrutinized by the software community, personally I do believe this to be true; some people simply are more effective than others, perhaps even an order of magnitude so.  I've been able to work with some truly talented people in my time as a software engineer, and there are even a few that I would include within that 10x category.  

However, there is a certain stereotype that comes along with the 10x label, as it usually conjures an image of a young hacker who can get in the flow and write an entire MVP overnight or solve a seemingly impossible bug in a matter of minutes (maybe without even looking at the code).  

While that skillset is one way to be a difference maker, one thing I learned over the course of my career is that I don't think I could ever be "that guy."  I'm simply not the type who can pull an all nighter although I'd like to think of myself as a good problem solver, some of the arcane intricacies of coding don't always come to me easily without study and practice.

I don't think that I should resign myself to just being a 1x developer, since I truly believe that there is way for any engineer (or product owner, designer, etc.) to 10x their value: help make everyone else in your team and in your organization more efficient.  Every time you unblock a teammate or go out of your way to collaborate with a colleague to lead them to a better solution is just as good as if you'd cowboy'd up and did it all yourself.  If you can help some teammates unlock 2x their potential and improve efficiency across the org by just a small percentage per person, the end result is the same.

Obviously improving efficiency of others takes a lot of hard work and persistence, certainly more than just being naturally gifted.  Even though it's not easy, I feel that it's the best way for me to contribute at a level above and beyond what might be expected of a single engineer.
