Software engineers live for optimization and efficiency. It's the nature of our profession. So when something slows when something slows me down, or even just _feels_ slower than it should be, I get annoyed, frustrated, and dare I say tilted.  Here are my top annoyances so far this year, in no particular order:

* **Mobile Emulators**
* **Long-running CI/CD Pipelines**
* **GitHub Issues**
* **Corporate VPNs/Proxies/Networking**
* **Terraform/Infrastructure as Code**

In my opinion, all of these gripes could be opportunities for a side project, open source solution, or even a business.  I wouldn't be surprised if there are existing remedies for these issues already out there.
