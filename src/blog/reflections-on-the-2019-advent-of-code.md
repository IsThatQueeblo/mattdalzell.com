Way back at the beginning of December 2019, I started on a coding challenge called [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).  The premise is simple: like a traditional advent calendar, each day leading up to Christmas Day in December provides a new surprise, but instead of candy one finds a new problem designed to test programming acumen.  

However as [Rich Hickey has famously explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oytL881p-nQ), "simple" is not synonymous with "easy," and finally after nearly six months I can say that I completed all 50 challenges.  All of the code can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mdalzell/advent-of-code-2019/), along with instructions on how to attain the solution to for a given day's problems.

Before shutting the door on this project, I wanted to take the time to gather some thoughts, impressions, and learnings from this entire experience:
* Probably the toughest part of any given problem was just getting started.  I would often read the prompt and think "How am I even supposed to solve this?" and then set it aside.  Once I started writing code in an editor, I always was able to find the solution eventually, even if it took all day.  Getting some code down, even it's trivial, gave me something to build off of and always lead to progress.
* I used these challenges as a way to learn Python, a popular language I wasn't super familiar with.  I figured that it would be a good tool for this, since it has simple syntax for string and list manipulation, which came in handy for most of the problems.  Overall, I wouldn't say Python is my favorite language, and I can't imagine building an API or web application with it like I would with Typescript or C#.  Despite this, I definitely learned how great that language can be at wrangling data, and even Python's object-oriented classes grew on me towards the end.  It'll be good to have some Python experience in my toolbox if I ever do want to perform more data or analytics-oriented work.
* In addition to learning a new language, these challenges forced me to heavily consider data structures and algorithms more than I typically do, since many of these problems can simply not be solved in a reasonable time without optimization.  I had to refresh myself on algorithms and other CS conscept I hadn't worked with much since college, so it was a lot of fun to get out of my comfort zone of building typical web applications. I feel like I have gained a new appreciation for the theoretical aspects of computer science now that I have years of software engineering experience under my belt.
