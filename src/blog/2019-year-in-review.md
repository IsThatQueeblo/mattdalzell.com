The past year has been a wild ride for me, with a lot of highs and some lows.  Overall, I think I've come out stronger both as a software engineer and as a person from some the experiences of the last year.  Here's some of the major accomplishments:

* Got married to awesome lady
* Started a new job (twice!)
* Learned a lot of new things in the past year (Azure/AWS, DevOps, terraform, launch darkly).  True senior level engineer
* Started volunteering more
* Reduced meat consumption in an attempt to help environment
* Switched to using elementaryOS as primary operating system
* Switched to protonmail for email
* Started playing guitar in a band again

I'm off to Savannah for my honeymoon, but when I come back I'm excited to hit the ground running in 2020 and keep improving on what I feel was an awesome and productive year.
