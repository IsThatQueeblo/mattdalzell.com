These blog posts are my own ill-conceived musings as a software engineer, and do not represent the views of any employer or client, past or present.

These posts are intended to be evergreen and the content may occasionally be updated if I learn new information.  Whenever I update an existing post, I try to make a note of it in the text for future reference.
