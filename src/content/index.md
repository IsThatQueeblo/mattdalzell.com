I am a software engineer based out of Chicago, IL, with seven years of professional experience in full stack web application and mobile development. Over the course of my career, I've worked on everything from distributed microservices to single page applications for businesses across a variety of industries. What I love about my profession is that every day is an opportunity to learn something new, build something cool, and have fun doing it.
