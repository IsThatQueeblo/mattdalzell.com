I am a software engineer based out of Chicago, IL, with 6 years of
professional experience in full stack web application
development. Over the course of my career, I've worked on everything from
large SaaS platforms to smaller apps for businesses across a variety of
industries.

My philosophy for software development is that the code is always improving,
or it is always getting worse; there is no such thing as staying the same. I
treat refactoring, bug fixing, and testing with the same care as I do writing
greenfield code. I enjoy the challenge of constructing code that is not only
functional, but maintainable in the long run.
